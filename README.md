🖥️ PC Management System (Python Console App)
This is a simple console-based PC Management System written in Python.
It simulates basic PC tasks such as checking system specs, monitoring resource usage, performing antivirus scans, checking for updates, and listing running processes.

🚀 Features
📊 View system specs (CPU, GPU, RAM, SSD info)

📈 Monitor real-time resource utilization (randomized for demo purposes)

🛡️ Simulated antivirus scan with threat detection

🔄 Check and apply system updates

📋 Display running and background processes

⚙️ Interactive menu-based interface

🧰 Requirements
Python 3.x

No external libraries required (only built-in modules: random, time)

▶️ How to Run
Make sure Python is installed.

Save the file as pc_manager.py

Run the script:

bash
Kopyala
Düzenle
python pc_manager.py
📌 Notes
This app does not interact with real system data — it's a simulation for educational/demo purposes.

Utilization values and antivirus results are generated randomly.

The interface is fully terminal-based and easy to extend.
